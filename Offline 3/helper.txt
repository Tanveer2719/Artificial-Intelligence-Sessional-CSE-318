findInitialSolution()
    randomly select 50% of the nodes and put them in S&T randomly
    while there is a unassigned vertex available iterate the while loop
        find the RCL
        from the RCL randomly select a batch of nodes and put them in S or T

localSearch()
    find the greedy value of the initialSolution
